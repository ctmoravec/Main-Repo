## New Mic (microbially influenced corrosion) Testing Brainstorming
--- 
- Potter charges us $425 per system. We will charge $525 for the test.
- We are looking to sell the test kit for not much of a mark up. The idea is to get the work of the pipe replacement, not the testing.
- This is to be done per system.

> [!note]+ What do we need to know when the sample is taken.
> • Labor Hours
> • Where to drain water.
> • Fire hoses. (How many)
> • End caps.
> • Nipples
> • Ball valves.
> • Bushings.
> • Lifts?
> • Access to branch line endpoints.

- Do they even want to get this involved or are they talking about pegging the flow switch and dumping the main drain for an hour?

## Common Misconceptions About MIC
--- 
> [!danger]+ Myth 1
> MIC is the primary cause of leaks in fire sprinkler systems.
>> [!important]+ Busted
>>Bacteria are always present, but oxygen is the primary cause of corrosion in fire sprinkler systems.

> [!danger]+ Myth 2
> Bad Water causes fire sprinkler system leaks.
>> [!important]+ Busted
>> Almost all fire supply water comes from fresh, clean municipal water supplies that are not chemically corrosive within the temperatures and pressures to which a fire sprinkler system would be exposed. 

> [!danger]- Myth 3
> Material Defective Sprinkler Pipe causes leaks, particularly at the weld seam.
>> [!important]+ Busted
>>  Pipe materials used today meet or exceed ASTM requirements incorporated in NFPA 13. Root cause analysis very rarely identifies material defect as the cause of failure.

> [!danger]- Myth 4
> Galvanized pipe provides better internal corrosion protection than black steel pipe.
> > [!important]+ Busted
>> All systems, even dry and pre-action, will trap water. When a galvanized surface is subject to persistent moisture, such as an accumulation of water, it will detach from the base metal and leave the steel exposed. Once the steel is exposed all of the oxygen available to react will preferentially corrode the exposed steel resulting in an accelerated leak.

> [!danger]- Myth 5
> Sprinkler systems with frequent leaks must be completely replaced.
>> [!important]+ Busted
>> Oxygen corrosion in fire sprinkler systems requires that oxygen, liquid water and steel pipe be in close proximity; corrosion is highly localized at air/water interfaces. On average, only 20% of system piping shows significant signs of corrosion.

### What is MIC?
--- 
![[MIC 1.png|435]]     ![[MIC 2.png]]

- Microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) is a type of metal damage caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, that thrive in moist or oxygen-deprived environments. These microbes produce substances, like acids or sulfides, that speed up the natural corrosion process, making materials like pipes, tanks, or other infrastructure degrade faster than usual. MIC is often found in water systems, industrial equipment, and underground structures, and it can lead to costly repairs if not addressed.

### How Frequently Should My System Be Tested?
--- 
#### General Recommendations:

1. **Initial Testing**:
    - When a new system is installed or significant changes are made, conduct MIC testing to establish baseline conditions and assess potential risks.
2. **Regular Testing**:
     - Systems with no history of MIC issues: Test every 3–5 years as a precautionary measure.
    - Systems with a history of MIC or located in high-risk environments (e.g., untreated water supplies, stagnant water areas): Test annually or biannually to monitor conditions closely.
3. **After Specific Events**:
    - If corrosion is observed, leaks occur, or debris is found during inspections, conduct MIC testing immediately to identify bacterial involvement.
4. **As Part of NFPA 25 Compliance**:
    - While NFPA 25 does not set a fixed frequency for MIC testing, it requires regular evaluations for conditions that could lead to internal corrosion, which often includes testing for MIC when warranted.
### What does the testing entail?
--- 
- The WTK (Water Test Kit) facilitates the collection of water samples from the sprinkler system. Upon submission, a certified laboratory conducts analyses to identify five groups of bacteria associated with corrosion:

- **Heterotrophic Bacteria**: Determines if the majority are anaerobic (without air) or aerobic (with air).
- **Slime-Forming Bacteria**: Contributes to tubercle (mound) formation on pipe walls.
- **Iron-Related Bacteria**: Involves iron-pipe oxidizing and reducing bacteria.
- **Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria**: Causes pitting corrosion.
- **Acid-Producing Bacteria**: Leads to pitting corrosion.

- Additionally, the test measures dissolved iron levels to assess the general corrosion status of the system. The bacterial cultures require approximately nine days to develop, with a comprehensive written report provided <u>ABOUT</u> 15 business days after testing commences.

- For existing sprinkler systems, Potter recommends collecting two water samples: one from the system's beginning or riser and another from the end. For new or proposed systems, a single sample from the source water suffices. Water from dry systems can also be evaluated using this kit.

- In summary, Potter's MIC testing process involves systematic sampling and laboratory analysis to detect corrosion-inducing bacteria, enabling informed decisions for effective corrosion management in fire sprinkler systems.

### So, my sample failed. Now what?

When a fire sprinkler system is affected by microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), it is critical to act quickly to restore the system's integrity and ensure continued fire protection. Below is an explanation of the main options available to address and mitigate MIC: flushing the system, pipe replacement, nitrogen generators, and regular inspections.

#### 1. Flush the System

Flushing the system is a vital first step in combating MIC. Over time, sprinkler pipes accumulate biofilms, debris, and sediments that harbor corrosion-causing bacteria. Flushing removes these contaminants, minimizing further damage to the pipes. There are different methods of flushing, such as high-pressure water flushing or chemical flushing with biocides to kill bacteria. This process not only cleans the system but also provides a clearer view of its internal condition. While flushing alone will not eliminate MIC, it is an essential measure to reduce its impact and prepare the system for further treatments, such as the application of biocides or inhibitors.

#### 2. Pipe Replacement

In cases where MIC has caused severe corrosion or leaks, pipe replacement may be unavoidable. During this process, affected pipe sections are removed and replaced with new ones. Consider using materials less susceptible to MIC, such as CPVC or stainless steel, depending on the system’s requirements and budget. Replacing pipes provides a fresh start for the system, reducing the likelihood of immediate recurrence. However, this option is typically more expensive and labor-intensive than others, making it most appropriate for systems with extensive damage or when other measures prove insufficient.

#### 3. Nitrogen Generators

[[Nitrogen generators]] are an advanced and highly effective solution for combating MIC in dry or pre-action sprinkler systems. MIC thrives in oxygenated environments, and nitrogen generators work by replacing the oxygen in pipes with nitrogen gas. This creates an environment that inhibits the growth of corrosion-causing bacteria and slows the overall corrosion process. Nitrogen generators are particularly effective for long-term system protection and can be installed as a permanent solution. While the initial investment may be higher, the long-term benefits, including reduced corrosion rates and extended system lifespan, often outweigh the costs.

#### 4. Regular Inspections

Ongoing maintenance and regular inspections are critical for preventing and managing MIC. Following the guidelines of NFPA 25, conduct routine inspections to monitor the system’s condition, identify early signs of corrosion, and ensure compliance with safety standards. Regular water sampling and testing can help detect bacterial activity and other conditions conducive to MIC before significant damage occurs. Proactive monitoring allows for early intervention, reducing the need for costly repairs and replacements.

#### <u>Integrating the Solutions</u>

The best approach to addressing MIC often involves a combination of these options. For instance, flushing the system can serve as a preliminary step before introducing nitrogen generators or replacing pipes. Regular inspections ensure the system remains in optimal condition, preventing future occurrences of MIC. Consulting with fire protection specialists can help tailor these solutions to your system’s unique requirements, ensuring long-term reliability and compliance with industry standards.

By addressing MIC proactively through these measures, you can protect your fire sprinkler system, extend its lifespan, and ensure it continues to provide reliable fire protection for your property.
